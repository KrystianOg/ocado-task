## Approach

To make the task a little bit simpler I'm allowing number operations such as floating point multiplication and division, in real world I'd operate on integers (bigint) or make backend calculate money operations.

## Running locally:

Clone repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrystianOg/ocado-task.git
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Technologies Used

- Vite - nowadays standard for starting with new frontend apps
- TypeScript
- React
- @tanstack/react-router - production grade routing
- eslint - mantaining clean, consistent code
